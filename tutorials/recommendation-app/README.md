# Building a recommendation application with Flink SQL

[Flink SQL](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/dev/table/overview/) is a powerful tool for data exploration, manipulation and inter-connection.
It allows you to access the power of Flink's distributed stream processing abilities with a familiar interface. 
In this tutorial we go over how to create an application, using Flink SQL for a retail sales company that wants to display a widget on product pages of similar products that the user might be interested in buying.
